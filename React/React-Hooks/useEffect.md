- `React.useEffect`Â is a built-in hook that allows you to run some custom code after React renders (and re-renders) your component to the DOM. It accepts a callback function which React will call after the DOM has been updated:
```javascript
// useEffect(setup, dependencies?)
React.useEffect(() => {
  // your side-effect code here.
  // this is where you can make HTTP requests or interact with browser APIs.
}, [])
```
